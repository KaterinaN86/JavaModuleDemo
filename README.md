Assignments for Java module
===================================================================================================================
## First task
- **/src/main/java/org/example/assignment1/Solution.java (uses recursion, not optimal when very long Strings need to be searched through)
- **/src/main/java/org/example/assignment1/Solution2.java

**Notes:**
- For this part of the assignment both the specified word that is being searched for ("BALLOON" in the given instructions) and the Strings that are being searched through ("BAONXXOLL", "BAOOLLNNOLOLGBAX" and so on) are hardcoded. I have also added another search with my own word and Strings to search through.
